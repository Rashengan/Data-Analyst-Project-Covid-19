This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world public datasets to uncover insights on case growth, mortality, testing, and vaccination across countries and over time.

Objectives:
Track daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths globally,
Compare case infection rates between countries and continents,
Identify peaks and trends in confirmed cases over time,
Monitor vaccination progress and its effect on case numbers,
Analyze test positivity rates and data completeness

Key SQL Analysis:
Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG),
Subqueries and CTEs,
Country-level comparisons with GROUP BY,
Case fatality rate (deaths / cases),
Vaccination rate tracking with conditional logic,
TEMP TABLE,
Creating View to store data for visualizations
